# pygame_shaders

I don't feel like writing documentation, so here are a couple things. Take a look at the code if you want to figure it out.

`shaders.py` contains all the functions.

`draw_lights()` is the function for drawing lights with shadows.

`draw_raw_lights()` draws without shadows.

2020 edit:
Please don't use this. It's old and garbage.
